To launch the project you need to have NodeJs installed.

#Node.js 
Node.js is used to scrape Michelin & LaFourchette website with 2 modules :

The module michelin is used to scrape all the French starred restaurants and store them into a JSON file (LinkRestaurant).

The module lafourchette is used to use this list of the French starred restaurants, and get the deals(if there are deals) and store it into another JSON file (JsonResto).

#React
The client side is working with React. We print all the French starred restaurants and their current deals.

#Just tell me what to do
Launch the Client-side with React with the following command:

1) Move to the directory of the React Application
cd my-app/src
